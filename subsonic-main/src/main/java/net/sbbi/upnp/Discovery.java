/**
 * Class to discover an UPNP device on the network.</br>
 * A multicast socket will be created to discover devices, the binding port for this socket is set to 1901,
 * if this is causing a problem you can use the net.sbbi.upnp.Discovery.bindPort system property 
 * to specify another port.
 * The discovery methods only accept matching device description and broadcast message response IP
 * to avoid a security flaw with the protocol. If you are not happy with such behaviour
 * you can set the net.sbbi.upnp.ddos.matchip system property to false to avoid this check.
