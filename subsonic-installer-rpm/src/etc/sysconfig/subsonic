# For example, to specify that Subsonic should use port 80 (for http)
# and 443 (for https), and use a Java memory heap size of 200 MB, use
# the following:
#
# SUBSONIC_ARGS="--port=80 --https-port=443 --max-memory=200"

SUBSONIC_ARGS="--max-memory=150"


# The user which should run the Subsonic process. Default "root".
# Note that non-root users are by default not allowed to use ports
# below 1024. Also make sure to grant the user write permissions in
# the music directories, otherwise changing album art and tags will fail.
